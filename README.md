A project for analyzing hockey data

## First Project: Draft Analysis

### Scraping Draft Data

`scraper.py` scrapes draft information from [hockey-reference.com](www.hockey-reference.com) on draft data, and puts it into a .csv data file. The script can be customized to focus on particular years, by default it's set to start in 1990.
